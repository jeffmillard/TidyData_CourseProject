Note, the original researchers named the 2nd and 3rd activities as \"WALKING UPSTAIRS\" and \"WALKING DOWNSTAIRS\".  I have interpreted that as walking up or down the stairs, respectively, and not simply walking on different floors of a building.\n\nThe subjects had Samsung Galaxy SII smartphones on their waists. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were recorded at a constant rate of 50Hz.\n\nThe original data set contained numerous measured and derived data based on the sensor (3D accelerometer and gyroscope) measurements.  Raw (unprocessed) data were included in the zip archive, but only the processed data were used in this analysis.\n\nData were randomly divided by subject into training and testing data.  For the \"tidy data\" analysis described herein, the training and testing data were combined into a single file.\n\nIn the original study, data were generated or derived according to:\n\n1. Type of data (time domain, frequency domain, vector angle).  Since all of the raw measurements were made in the time domain, frequency was calculated by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and angle was calculated by vector transformation of the 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data.\n\n2. Type of sensor (time and frequency domain only).  There were 2 sensor types: Accelerometer and Gyroscope.\n\n3. Type of acceleration (body motion or gravity).\n\n4. Axis of measurement (Cartesian axes X, Y, Z)\n\n5.
